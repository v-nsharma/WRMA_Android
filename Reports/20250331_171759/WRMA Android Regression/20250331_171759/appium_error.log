[38;5;124m[bce6afe2][0m[38;5;-150m[AndroidUiautomator2Driver@a2bb][0m Hidden API policy (https://developer.android.com/guide/app-compatibility/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces) cannot be enabled. This might be happening because the device under test is not configured properly. Please check https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/13802 for more details. You could also set the "appium:ignoreHiddenApiPolicyError" capability to true in order to ignore this error, which might later lead to unexpected crashes or behavior of the automation server.
